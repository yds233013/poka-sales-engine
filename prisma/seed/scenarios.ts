    body: `Hi,

We're replacing the pumps on Line 4 at the Dallas plant. We currently run AX-220 units there but the loop is being converted to thermal fluid and will sit at 180 C continuous, so we need something rated for higher temperature.

Need 12 units delivered to the Dallas plant within two weeks — the line is down from the 30th and we can't miss that window.

The existing baseplates and pipework are staying, so whatever you propose has to land on what's already there. If the AX-220 can't be made to work please recommend something compatible.

Can you quote this?

Could you price up 5 off MX-160 for us? Same as the units on the glycol skid — 316 stainless, ATEX Zone 1 area, 460V 3ph, DN50 connections, running around 35 m3/h at 90 C.

No great rush but I'd like them on site inside the month.
